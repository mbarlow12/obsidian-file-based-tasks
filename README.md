### Why?
Another task management plugin??? What's the point? I'm glad you asked! Most similar plugins utilize the preview mode and/or dataview to display tasks on the screen. Even in the live preview mode, keyboard interaction is sorely lacking, especially when using the dataview plugin.

The goal is to allow for seamless interaction with any task without leaving the editor as well as consolidated tracking of all tasks across your
vault. Regardless of what you might be working on, you can pop in a checklist item and continue on with whatever you were doing. The plugin will
create a dedicated file for the task or update the existing task file with the location you just added and update all files related to the task
display (@see [Index Files]).
